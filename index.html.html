       <h2>Summary or Objective Statement</h2>
       <hr/>
       <p>I am a tech lawyer who is ambitious with a proven track record of academic excellence.
        I graduated with a First Class Honours from my University and Law School. 
        My interest in the tech space started since when i was a child. Having zero knowledge about computers,
        i helped my mother set up her first computer, putting all the wires at the right places and getting it to work.
        I stayed curious growing up about computers and its functionalities. However, I did not pursue computer science with no regret
        becuase it was a profession i knew i still end up learning about. I am currently Technology, Media and Telecommunication (TMT) law.
